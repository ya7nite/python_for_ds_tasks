# Repository Description

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebook files covering various topics related to Python and data analysis. Each notebook addresses a specific topic and contains exercises, explanations, and practical examples to help users understand and practice different concepts.

## Contents:
-**International_Grocery_Store_Analytics.ipynb:** The repository that represents my final course work.

- **12_python_loops_1.ipynb:** This notebook presents a series of tasks related to Python and loops. The tasks range from basic operations with lists to creating dictionaries from lists and manipulating unique elements. For operations such as multiplying elements of a list, comparing elements between two lists, and counting repetitions of elements in a list, for loops are used. It also demonstrates how to check for the presence of elements in a list and how to find the smallest unique elements. Solutions are presented both with conventional loops and with list and dictionary comprehensions.

- **2_python_functions_classes_exceptions_2.ipynb:** This exercise notebook covers a variety of topics in Python, focusing on functions, classes, and exceptions. It includes tasks such as determining even numbers, generating lists of random integers, calculating body mass index (BMI), computing distances, modeling shops and employees, and managing birthday greetings for employees. Each exercise provides code snippets and expected results for implementation and verification purposes.

- **3_pandas_2.ipynb:** The notebook analyzes sales data, examining aspects such as product sales, profitability, average ratings, and purchasing patterns by day and month. It also identifies the most and least profitable branches, along with peak sales hours. Three additional questions are formulated to explore customer behavior, with answers based on data analysis. In summary, it provides a detailed insight to inform business decision-making.
- **4._Data_visualizations.ipynb:** The notebook explores a taxi dataset, focusing on data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. It begins by identifying and handling missing values, then proceeds to convert datetime columns and derive new features. Visualizations include plots of total daily pickups over time, distributions of pickups by borough, and histograms and box plots to analyze total daily pickups by borough. Additional visualizations examine the distribution of trips by hour and the number of trips in each borough. Analysis includes exploring tipping patterns based on payment method. Overall, the notebook provides a comprehensive exploration of taxi data, enabling insights into pickup trends, borough distributions, and tipping behavior.
- **5_Python + SQL.ipynb:** The notebook uses Python and SQL to extract, analyze, and visualize data from a MySQL database called "employees." SQL queries are performed to obtain information about hire dates, salaries, and duration in a specific position. The data is then processed and visualized using pandas and matplotlib/seaborn. This approach allows you to quickly explore information and obtain significant insights about the company's workforce.
- **6._Statistics.ipynb:** The notebook conducts statistical analysis and hypothesis testing using Python, including data visualization, normality tests, hypothesis testing for mean using z-test and t-test, comparison of two datasets using z-test, and A/B testing analysis to evaluate the effect of changes in a game feature on user retention rates. Additionally, required sample sizes are calculated, proportions z-tests are performed, and contingency table analysis for chi-square tests is conducted. In summary, the notebook provides a comprehensive overview of statistical analysis techniques and hypothesis testing applied to real-world datasets.

- **additional_tasks_bazovi_tipi_danix_cikli.ipynb:** The notebook demonstrates Python operations for data analysis, including variable conversions, statistical calculations, and hypothesis testing. It also counts letters in words, checks for palindromes, and calculates the remaining years until age 100 for a list of users. Overall, it covers fundamental and advanced Python operations for data analysis and manipulation.

- **functions_list_comprehensions_classes.ipynb:** In this notebook, data processing and object modeling operations were performed in Python. Used functions, loops, and classes to manipulate lists, calculate areas and perimeters of circles, and manage student information, including extension.

- **pandas_additional.ipynb:** In the notebook, I used Pandas to load and clean a CSV dataset. Performed transformations on columns, such as changing the date format and converting data to numeric. Next, I performed exploratory analysis, including exploring unique values ​​and identifying the top 10 in text columns. I calculated the median salary based on English proficiency and explored the salary-job title relationship. I also analyzed salary distribution in major cities and grouped salary by experience and job position. Finally, I summarized the actions taken and the conclusions obtained from the analysis.
- **python_data_structures_loops_and_functions.ipynb:** The code performs various operations in Python, including manipulating data in lists and dictionaries, defining functions to print patterns, and analyzing elements in sets.
